Problem Statement :-
The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning model that accurately estimates the
total production of caps based on Date & Time and Production per hour features. The
model aims to contribute to optimizing production planning and resource allocation.
Problems to Solve:-
1) Outlier Detection and outlier treatment of 'Production Per Hour' feature
2) Train a Machine Learning model that accurately estimates the total production of 50000
caps based on Date & Time and Production per hour features.
